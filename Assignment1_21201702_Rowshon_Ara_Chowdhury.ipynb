Two words are anagrams if they contain all of the same letters, but in a different  order. For example, “evil” and “live” are anagrams because each contains one “e”,  one “i”, one “l”, and one “v”. \n","Write a program that reads two strings from the user and determines whether or not they  are anagrams. Use a dictionary to solve the problem.\n","\n","Sample Input \n","\n","evil \n","\n","live \n","\n","Sample Output \n","\n","Those strings are anagrams.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"uZM6F780iZaW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["s1=input()\n","s2=input()\n","d1={}\n","d2={}\n","if len(s1)==len(s2):\n","  for i in range(len(s1)):\n","    d1[s1[i]]=i\n","  for i in range(len(s1)):\n","    d2[s2[i]]=i\n","  if d1.keys()==d2.keys():\n","    print(\"Those strings are anagrams.\")\n","  else:\n","    print(\"Those strings are not anagrams.\")\n","  \n","else:\n","  print(\"Those strings are not anagrams.\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"K--ldEpfkHjE","outputId":"66bfa2e3-28c9-4a56-80ee-bbc62812c07d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["live\n","life\n","Those strings are not anagrams.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#####task 5\n","string1=input()\n","string=\"\"\n","for i in range(len(string1)):\n","    if ord(string1[i])>=97 and ord(string1[i])<=122:\n","        string = string + chr(ord(string1[i]) - 32)\n","    else:\n","        string = string + string1[i]\n","s=\"\"\n","total={1:[\".\",\",\",\"?\",\"!\",':'],2:[\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"],3:[\"D\",\"E\",\"F\"],4:[\"G\",\"H\",'I'],5:[\"J\",\"K\",\"L\"],6:[\"M\",\"N\",\"O\"],7:[\"P\",\"Q\",\"R\",\"S\"],8:[\"T\",\"U\",\"V\"],9:[\"W\",\"X\",\"Y\",\"Z\"],0:[\" \"]}\n","for i in range(len(string)):\n","    for j,k in total.items():\n","        if string[i] in k:\n","            for l in range(len(k)):\n","                if string[i] ==k[l]:\n","                    x=len(k[:l+1])\n","                    for t in range(x):\n","                        s=s+str(j)\n","print(s)\n","                        "],"metadata":{"id":"5BoGmIUhrU5i","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"f51b726b-e9de-49ff-8011-69c72a1be1aa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1646734958943,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":5613,"user":{"displayName":"ROWSHON ARA CHOWDHURY","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiIi42CUla9ZCgo3dC_EskMbuRniJvhVAhUmXse=s64","userId":"05437628018935418832"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello\n","4433555555666\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"AtdmA3KrCLAH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
